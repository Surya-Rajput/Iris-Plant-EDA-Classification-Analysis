# Iris Plant Classification Analysis

This repository is dedicated to the analysis and classification of iris plants using the well-known Iris dataset. Fisher's classic paper on this dataset remains a cornerstone in the field of pattern recognition.

## Task

The primary task of this project is to predict the class of iris plants based on their features. The project aims to answer the following questions:

### Key Tasks
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the dataset features using histograms to gain insights into the data distribution.

2. **Target Variable Encoding:** Convert the target variable into a numeric format for modeling.

3. **Experiment with Different Data Split Ratios:**
   - Perform experiments using two different ratios of training, validation, and test data: 60-20-20 and 80-10-10.
   - Implement KFold Cross Validation to assess model performance.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Implement Grid Search to find optimal hyperparameters for three selected algorithms (e.g., LR, SVM, MLP, RF, Boosting).

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Analyze the results on the validation and test sets.
   - Determine which model performed the best and provide explanations.

6. **Model Performance Comparison:**
   - Compare model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and latency.
   - Identify the best proportion or split ratio of data from the conducted experiments.
